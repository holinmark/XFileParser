# XFileParser
A DirectX 11.0 x file mesh parser.

To use type:
application.exe <options>

options are:
-trackoutput
-f <name of a mesh file>

trackoutput is used to debug mesh file.  By default there is no output as the file is parsed.
"-trackoutput" print to standard output the content of the mesh file as it is read.
-f <file name>, without '<' and '>', is a DirectX mesh file.
Example app.exe -f ./meshes/CubeMesh.x
If -f option is not used, then the program looks for a file called 'file.txt' and inside of said file is the name of a
DirectX mesh file.
Example inside of file.txt is ".//meshes//CubeMesh.x", without quotes.

If I have time I'll add more descriptions.  If you have notepad.exe installed then an error will open notepad.exe displaying
the error in the mesh file.

sMeshList.h

struct sMeshList is where all the mesh data is stored. It is stored in a linked list:
	'pfirstmesh' points to the first mesh.
	'plastmesh' points to the last mesh.

struct sMesh is where each individual mesh is stored:
	'name' is the name of the mesh, if no name is assigned to the mesh the an arbitrary name is given.
	'vertices' is where all the vertices is stored.
	'meshfaces' is where all the polygons of the mesh is stored.
	'p_extra' is a pointer to more mesh data:
		normals; texture coordinates; skinning information; matrix; materials; duplicates; animation data; color
		points to NULL if there is no extra information on the mesh.
	'pnextmesh' points to the next mesh. Points to NULL at end.
